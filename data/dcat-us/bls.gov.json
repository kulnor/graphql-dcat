Specifically, average prices are estimates of the average price paid by the consumer for a good or service.\r\n\r\nAt the U.S. level, the BLS publishes approximately 70 average prices for food items, 6 for utility gas (natural gas) and electricity, and 5 for automotive fuels.

Designated the C-CPI-U, the index supplements the existing Consumer Price Indexes already produced by the BLS: the CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) and the CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The C-CPI-U employs a Tornqvist formula and utilizes expenditure data in adjacent time periods in order to reflect the effect of any substitution that consumers make across item categories in response to changes in relative prices. The new measure is designed to be a closer approximation to a \"cost-of-living\" index than the present measures. The use of expenditure data for both a base period and the current period in order to average price change across item categories distinguishes the C-CPI-U from the existing CPI measures, which use only a single expenditure base period to compute the price change over time."

The survey covers paid leave benefits such as holidays and vacations, and person, funeral, jury duty, military, parental, and sick leave; sickness and accident, long-term disability, and life insurance; medical, dental, and vision care plans; defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans; flexible benefits plans; reimbursement accounts; and unpaid parental leave.

To compile counts that are as complete as possible, the census uses multiple sources to identify, verify, and profile fatal worker injuries. Information about each workplace fatal injury\u2014occupation and other worker characteristics, equipment involved, and circumstances of the event\u2014is obtained by cross-referencing the source records, such as death certificates, workers' compensation reports, and Federal and State agency administrative reports. To ensure that fatal injuries are work-related, cases are substantiated with two or more independent source documents, or a source document and a follow-up questionnaire. Data compiled by the CFOI program are issued annually for the preceding calendar year.\r\n\r\nMore information and details about the data provided can be found at https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshfat1.htm",

Unadjusted counts and rates of all data elements are published by supersector and select sector based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The number of unfilled jobs\u2014used to calculate the job openings rate\u2014is an important measure of the unmet demand for labor. With that statistic, it is possible to paint a more complete picture of the U.S. labor market than by looking solely at the unemployment rate, a measure of the excess supply of labor. Information on labor turnover is valuable in the proper analysis and interpretation of labor market developments and as a complement to the unemployment rate. \r\n\r\nFor more information and data visit: https://www.bls.gov/jlt/",

The modeled wage estimates are produced using a statistical procedure that combines survey data collected by the National Compensation Survey (NCS) and the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) programs. Borrowing from the strengths of the NCS, information on job characteristics and work levels, and from the OES, the occupational and geographic detail, the modeled wage estimates provide more detail on occupational average hourly wages than either program is able to provide separately.\r\n\r\nWage rates for different work levels within occupation groups also are published.

            "description": "The Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures the average change over time in selling prices received by domestic producers of goods and services. PPIs measure price change from the perspective of the seller. This contrasts with other measures, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), that measure price change from the purchaser's perspective. Sellers' and purchasers' prices may differ due to government subsidies, sales and excise taxes, and distribution costs.\r\n\r\nThere are three main PPI classification structures which draw from the same pool of price information provided to the BLS by cooperating company reporters:\r\n\r\n        Industry classification. A Producer Price Index for an industry is a measure of changes in prices received for the industry's output sold outside the industry (that is, its net output). The PPI publishes approximately 535 industry price indexes in combination with over 4,000 specific product line and product category sub-indexes, as well as, roughly 500 indexes for groupings of industries. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) index codes provide comparability with a wide assortment of industry-based data for other economic programs, including productivity, production, employment, wages, and earnings.\r\n        Commodity classification. The commodity classification structure of the PPI organizes products and services by similarity or material composition, regardless of the industry classification of the producing establishment. This system is unique to the PPI and does not match any other standard coding structure. In all, PPI publishes more than 3,700 commodity price indexes for goods and about 800 for services (seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted), organized by product, service, and end use.\r\n        Commodity-based Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID) System. Commodity-based FD-ID price indexes regroup commodity indexes for goods, services, and construction at the subproduct class (six-digit) level, according to the type of buyer and the amount of physical processing or assembling the products have undergone. The PPI publishes over 600 FD-ID indexes (seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted) measuring price change for goods, services, and construction sold to final demand and to intermediate demand. The FD-ID system replaced the PPI stage-of-processing (SOP) system as PPI's primary aggregation model with the release of data for January 2014. The FD-ID system expands coverage in its aggregate measures beyond that of the SOP system by incorporating indexes for services, construction, exports, and government purchases.\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit: https://www.bls.gov/ppi",
